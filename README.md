# password-generator
Generating a random password based on chosen length and variables.

Page is configured to display a series of prompts when the generate button is clicked. Prompts include password length and options for lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters.

Issues I've run into include the generator not including all selected variables on occasion. Also, if password is generated correctly and the the generate button is selected again, a new password will generate even if the length entered is outside of the parameters and the alert is shown.

A link to my project URL via GitHub is available [here](https://lexiehansen.github.io/password-generator/).

Here are screenshots of the completed webpage.
